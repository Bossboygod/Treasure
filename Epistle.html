            <p class="lead">
                i honestly dont know where to even start writing from because youve more than just a friend...
                The words i write wouldn't even be enough to describe your person
                I can remember vividly the first time i saw youðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚...you were looking so gentle like one angel sent from above...
                Little did i know you were far from being gentle. The stories or memories i would have written about to make you smile all revolves around your last relationship
                and i wouldn't want to bring that up at all. But i have never and will never regret meeting you. The things you've done for me ehn... i am still even looking for a way
                to reciprocate it and even do bigger. It's your selflessness for me ..Even sometimes you like shakara too much
                Thanking for being the best friend anyone could ever have... Thank you always being there. Thank you for everything cause if i begin to mention we won't leave here ...i 
                believe i have written more than enough description in both of the pages...making it too long would bore you cause of course you won't be reading just my epistle on that day
                but i just want to wish you a happy birthday...more life...more money...more beauty...more of every of the good things life has to offer...more spending..more boyfriends
                more brainsssss... and one more
                Iâ€™m a better friend than you. 
                Want me to prove it? This year I have made you a birthday gift of the magnitude that you wonâ€™t dare try to compete with.
                cause i know you are not a web developerðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ 
                But Iâ€™m not looking for anything expensive in return. 
                All I want is for you to continue being my friend and the 
                beautiful person that you are!...Happy birthday once again...i loveeee youuuuðŸ’–ðŸ’–<br>
                Below is a Short video to make you smile more.
